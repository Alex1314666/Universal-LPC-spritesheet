I just keep adding bits and pieces of art prepared for the LPC by:

Luke Mehl
---------
Most of the female assets

Johannes Sj√∂lund
----------------
Most of the male assets

Marcel van de Steeg
-------------------
Tanned and dark skinned variants

Manuel Riecke
-------------
Female hair base colors

They are not responsible for any terrible job I do messing with color sliders for hair and clothing.
