Universal Sprite Sheet
======================

An attempt to consolidate all of the humanoid entries from the Liberated Pixel Cup, lpc.opengameart.org, into a single GIMP project, as well as to try and make most clothing accessible by either gender.

Collaborating
=============

If you'd like to help out, please do so!  I've worked with @joewhite to hammer out some basic guidelines:
 - Edit the .png files, not the .xcf.  Once the pull is merged, a maintainer (@makrohn) will fold the .png files into the .xcf
 - If the .png file for the layer you want to edit doesn't exist yet, just export it from GIMP, commit it, and then edit it, so that the difference can be seen in the pull request
 - As with code, try to keep pull requests grouped thematically - eg, "skintonefixes" "suitandtie" "blackshoes" so they can be evaluated separately.
